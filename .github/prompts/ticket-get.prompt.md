# Get ticket from Jira

1. Use the atlassian MCP to find a ticket assigned to the current user, which is in the sprint and has the highest priority. Let the user verify the selected ticket is the one to work with.
2. Follow `ticket-create.prompt.md` to create a ticket based on the ticket number and ticket title. Include the description in jira and any comments in the ticket.
